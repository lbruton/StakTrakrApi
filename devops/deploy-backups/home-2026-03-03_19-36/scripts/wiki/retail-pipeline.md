# Retail Market Price Pipeline

> **Last verified:** 2026-02-25 — dual-poller architecture, Turso shared DB, readLatestPerVendor() merge logic

---

## Overview

The retail pipeline scrapes coin dealer prices from ~11 vendors × 12 coins (including `goldback-g1`) every cycle, writes to a shared Turso database, then exports to REST JSON and pushes to GitHub Pages.

Two independent pollers write to the **same Turso database**. A single publisher script on Fly.io merges their data using latest-per-vendor logic and pushes to the `api` branch.

---

## Dual-Poller Architecture

| Poller | Location | Cron | Script | POLLER_ID |
|--------|----------|------|--------|-----------|
| **Fly.io** (primary) | `staktrakr` app, `dfw` region | `*/15 * * * *` | `run-local.sh` | `api` |
| **Home LXC** (secondary) | Proxmox Ubuntu @ 192.168.1.81 | `0,30 * * * *` (2×/hr) | `run-home.sh` | `home` |

**Why two pollers?**
- Redundancy — if Fly.io misses a cycle, home poller fills the gap within 30 min
- Both write to the same Turso DB; `run-publish.sh` merges via `readLatestPerVendor()` — most recent row per vendor within last 2h wins
- No branch conflicts — the home poller never pushes to Git, only writes to Turso

---

## Script Responsibilities

### Scrape scripts (`run-local.sh` / `run-home.sh`)

1. Sync `providers.json` from `api` branch via curl
2. `price-extract.js` — scrape dealers, write results to Turso `price_snapshots`
3. `capture.js` — screenshots via Playwright (Fly.io only)
4. `extract-vision.js` — Gemini Vision cross-validation (Fly.io only, requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
5. **Done** — does NOT touch Git

### `run-publish.sh` (Fly.io only, every 15 min: `8,23,38,53 * * * *`)

1. Lockfile guard (`/tmp/retail-publish.lock`) — skips if previous run still active
2. `api-export.js` — reads Turso via `readLatestPerVendor()`, builds `data/api/` JSON
3. `git add data/` + commit if changed
4. Force-push `HEAD:api` to `StakTrakrApi` `api` branch

> **Single writer, no merge conflicts.** Force-push is intentional — Fly.io is the sole Git writer for the `api` branch data files.

## Turso Database

**Table:** `price_snapshots`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scraped_at` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of scrape |
| `window_start` | 15-min window bucket (legacy, kept for compatibility) |
| `coin_slug` | e.g. `ase`, `age`, `maple-silver` |
| `vendor` | Provider ID, e.g. `jmbullion`, `apmex` |
| `price` | Scraped price (null if OOS or failed) |
| `source` | `firecrawl` or `playwright` |
| `in_stock` | false if OOS patterns matched |
| `is_failed` | true if scrape threw an error |

### `readLatestPerVendor()` — the dual-poller merge function

`api-export.js` uses `readLatestPerVendor(db, coinSlug, lookbackHours=2)` which returns the **most recent row per vendor** within the last 2 hours. This means both pollers' data shows up regardless of which time window they ran in.

---

## providers.json

Lives on the **`api` branch** at `data/retail/providers.json`. Both pollers curl this before each run — URL corrections take effect next cycle with **no redeploy needed**.

### URL strategy

Prefer random-year / dates-our-choice SKUs when in stock. At year-start, Monument Metals random-year SKUs go pre-order while year-specific (e.g. `2026-american-silver-eagle.html`) are in stock — switch to year-specific until bulk stock arrives.

See [providers.md](providers.md) for full details.

---

## Multi-URL Fallback (`price-extract.js`)

Since 2026-02-23, each provider entry can specify a `urls` array instead of a single `url`. The scraper tries each URL in sequence using a two-phase strategy:

**Phase 1 — Firecrawl chain (all URLs):**

| Event at URL[i] | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| OOS detected | Log ⚠, jitter, try URL[i+1] |
| Price not found (page loaded) | Log ?, jitter, try URL[i+1] |
| Firecrawl error | Log ✗, jitter, try URL[i+1] |
| Price found | Log ✓, break — skip remaining URLs |

**Phase 2 — Playwright (last resort, once):**
Only runs after the full Firecrawl chain is exhausted with no price. Uses `finalUrl` (the last URL tried). If Playwright also fails, result is recorded as `price_not_found` or `out_of_stock`.

Single-`url` entries are backward compatible — treated as a 1-element `urls` list.

---

## OOS Detection (`price-extract.js`)

`detectStockStatus(markdown, weightOz, providerId)` checks scraped text for out-of-stock signals before price extraction.

**Global patterns:** `out of stock`, `sold out`, `currently unavailable`, `notify me when available`, `email when in stock`, `temporarily out of stock`, `back order`, `pre-order`/`preorder`, `notify me`

**Per-provider exceptions:**

`PREORDER_TOLERANT_PROVIDERS = Set(["jmbullion"])`

JMBullion marks some coins as Presale/Pre-Order but still shows live purchasable prices. The `pre-?order` pattern is skipped for `jmbullion`. Affected coins at year-start: `buffalo`, `maple-silver`, `maple-gold`, `krugerrand-silver`.

---

## Tiered Scraper Fallback (T1–T4)

As of 2026-02-24, the retail pipeline has four automatic recovery layers for scrape failures:

| Tier | Method | Trigger | How |
|------|--------|---------|-----|
| T1 | Tailscale residential IP | If `tailscaled` socket present | `run-local.sh` socket-checks before each cycle — gracefully skipped if Tailscale not running |
| T2 | Fly.io datacenter IP | Tailscale unreachable | Automatic fallback in same ping-check |
| T3 | Webshare proxy + cron retry | SKUs still failed after T1/T2 | `run-retry.sh` fires at `:15`; re-scrapes failed slugs only |
| T4 | Turso last-known-good | T3 also fails for a vendor | `api-export.js` fills from `price_snapshots` at publish time |

### Failure signal: `/tmp/retail-failures.json`

`price-extract.js` writes this file after each run listing SKUs that failed **both** the main scrape and the FBP backfill. `run-retry.sh` reads it at `:15` and clears it on exit.

- If the file is absent → `:15` cron is a no-op
- If ≥80% of targets are in the file → `run-local.sh` logs `[WARN] SYSTEMIC` for monitoring

### T4 manifest output

When T4 fills a vendor slot, the manifest entry includes extra fields the frontend can use:

```json
"herobullion": {
  "price": 34.21,
  "source": "turso_last_known",
  "stale": true,
  "stale_since": "2026-02-24T14:00:00Z",
  "inStock": true
}
```

## Vision Pipeline (Fly.io only)

Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Non-fatal — failure is logged and scrape continues.

1. **`capture.js`** — Playwright screenshots each dealer page. Dismisses popups/modals (Escape + common close selectors) before screenshot.
2. **`extract-vision.js`** — Sends screenshots to Gemini Vision. Extracts price from image, compares against Firecrawl price.

| Scenario | Confidence |
|----------|-----------|
| Firecrawl + Vision agree (≤3% diff) | 99 |
| Vision only (Firecrawl null) | ~70 |
| Firecrawl + Vision disagree (>3% diff) | ≤70, scaled by divergence |
| Firecrawl only, no Vision | `scoreVendorPrice()` vs 30-day median |

---

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Vendor missing prices multiple cycles | URL changed, OOS, or bot-blocked | Add backup URLs via `urls` array in providers.json — auto-synced next cycle, no redeploy |
| Only 1-2 vendors per coin | Poller down or Turso connectivity | Check `fly logs` and home LXC cron; verify Turso has recent rows |
| JMBullion presale coins show OOS | `pre-?order` matching before provider check | Verify `PREORDER_TOLERANT_PROVIDERS` includes `jmbullion` in price-extract.js |
| OOM on Fly.io | Concurrent api-export.js invocations | Verify run-local.sh does NOT call api-export.js; run-publish.sh has lockfile |
| Monument Metals missing at year-start | Random-year SKUs on pre-order | Switch to year-specific SKU in providers.json |
| Vendor price marked `stale: true` in manifest | T3 proxy retry also failed — T4 filled from last known Turso row | Check `/var/log/retail-retry.log`; top up Webshare quota if over limit |
| `[WARN] SYSTEMIC` in retail-poller.log | ≥80% of SKUs failed — likely Fly.io IP blocked | Check egress IP (`curl ifconfig.me` in container); Webshare T3 will retry at `:15` |

## Deployment Notes

- **Code changes** — `git push origin main` then `fly deploy` from `devops/retail-poller/`
- **providers.json URL fixes** — push to `api` branch; auto-synced next cycle, no redeploy
- **Home LXC code update** — curl changed files from `raw.githubusercontent.com/lbruton/StakTrakrApi/main/devops/retail-poller/`
- **After deploy** — `fly logs --app staktrakr | grep -E 'retail|publish|ERROR'`
